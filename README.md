# screeps
Jeff and Justen's collaboration to make Jeff's Screeps code suck less (that should be easy).

### Notes for this branch
This converts all changes to the Memory object to room based memory.
I still need to test the "creep.room.memory" reference to see if that actually works the way it is intended (Accessing the memory for the room the creep is in to retrieve information that the creep wants)
